This is a simple sorting algorithm website, containing algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort... [Website Link](https://rdhirschel.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms-Website/)

Features:
* Visualization for each sort with a brief explanation at the start of each sorting algorithm on how it operates.
* The amount boxes that are being displayed on each sort are changeable, ranging from 1-100.
* Bogo Sort.

Currently Known Bugs:
* When clicking on the Sort and Randomize buttons too fast - It sometimes causes the sorting/randomizing to glitch out. I'll probably fix it in the future.
